# Working Set (AI)

Agents MUST keep this file updated during a task. Use it to build the Nia query preamble.

## Current objective
- <one sentence describing the task>

## Repo scope
- repository: <owner>/<repo>
- in-scope paths (if known):
  - <path>

## Stack tags (pick from docs/ai/stack-registry.md)
- <stack-tag>

## Known identifiers (exact strings)
- files:
  - <path>
- symbols:
  - <symbol>
- routes:
  - <route>
- error strings:
  - <string>

## Expected behavior
- <expected behavior>

## Constraints
- <constraints, assumptions, or environment notes>

## Verification
- <commands or manual steps>

## Nia query preamble (fill before calling Nia)
Repo: <owner>/<repo>
Branch: main
Goal: <one sentence>
Area: <dir/module/file guess>
Stack: <3-8 tags from stack-registry.md>
Keywords: <5-12 exact identifiers/strings>
Constraints: <runtime/tooling/behavior constraints>
Evidence required: file paths + symbol names + brief explanation
